Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary cause of amnesia in older adults and is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive decline and memory loss. Other conditions that can lead to amnesia 
include Traumatic Brain Injury, Stroke, Encephalitis, and Transient Global Amnesia. Early and accurate diagnosis of AD plays a crucial role. Machine learning techniques have shown great potential in aiding the 
diagnosis of AD by analyzing large-scale datasets and extracting meaningful patterns and features from the MRI images of brain. The classification of MRI images from the open accessible datasets. Classification of 
the AD using deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) along with VGG16 algorithm. The system follows various activities like dataset acquisition, image segmentation, feature extraction and classification. The projected arrangement accomplishes noteworthy performance with the finest accuracy. As, the accuracy increases classification will be accurate without any prior errors. 
The primary focus is on leveraging deep learning algorithms to analyze MRI images of the brain and classify them into different stages of Alzheimer's disease. By implementing a web application, users can upload MRI
images, and the system will provide predictions regarding the stage of Alzheimer's disease along with associated confidence levels. Additionally, the system offers personalized precautions and recommendations based
on the predicted stage, aiding caregivers and individuals in understanding and managing the condition effectively.
